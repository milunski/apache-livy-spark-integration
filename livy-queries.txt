Notes:
    - Session ID is unique, and Livy won't allow you to start another session with the same name 
    unless you kill the first session.
    - Could statement incrementer be a problem? Need to keep track of the incremental number of statements made or kill the session.
    - Need to escape quotes (\"foo\") with JSON in cURL...
